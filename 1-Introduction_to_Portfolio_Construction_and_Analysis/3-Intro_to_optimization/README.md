Module 2 : 

1. Inro to optimization and the Efficient Frontier
2. Implementing Markowitz

Modern portfolio theory was born with the efficient frontier analysis of Markowitz (1952). 
Unfortunately, early applications of the technique, based on na√Øve estimates of the input parameters, have been found of little use because leading to non-sensible portfolio allocations. 
Moreover the relevance of the mean-variance paradigm has been questioned with heightened scrutiny in the context of sharp market downturns. This section of the course explains how to implement efficient frontier analysis in the presence and in the absence of a risk-free asset. It also discusses how to extend Markowitz analysis so as to make it consistent with real-world constraints.
