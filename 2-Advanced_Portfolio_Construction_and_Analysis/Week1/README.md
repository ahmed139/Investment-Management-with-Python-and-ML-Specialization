# Week 1 - Key Points

In recent years there has been increasing recognition of the importance of factor models in portfolio construction and analysis. 

This first module provides an in-depth introduction to the most popular factor models used in investment practice, starting with William Sharpe’s Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and then moving on multi-factor models.

We also discuss style analysis, which can be regarded as a constrained form of factor model, and which has been applied to the analysis of the performance of active managers. 

Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of cap-weighted equity indices, including their inefficient exposure to rewarded risk factors, and we also discuss the recent “smart beta” approach, which has been introduced as a formal methodology allowing investors and asset managers to build more efficient portfolios.
