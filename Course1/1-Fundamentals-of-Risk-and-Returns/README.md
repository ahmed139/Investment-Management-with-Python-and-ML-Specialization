# Fundamentals of Risk and Returns

## Key Points

Introducing: 

* The basic risk and performance measures that are key to portfolio analysis and management. 
* Volatility as the standard risk measure, 
* statistical significance and persistence of non-normality risks, emphasizing an understanding of higher-order moments and how to use them for allocating to assets with non-normal returns.

We also introduce downside risk measures such as Value-at-Risk and Conditional-Value-at-Risk measures, which are more relevant risk measures in the presence of non-normally distributed asset returns.
